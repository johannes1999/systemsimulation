=====================================================================

The ROB_DES toolbox may be installed as any extension toolbox to the
standard MATLAB functions.

1) Copy all ROB_DES toolbox functions from a floppy disk to a (new)
   harddisk directory. From DOS command prompt:

      CD C:\MATLAB4\TOOLBOX
      MKDIR ROB_DES
      CD ROB_DES
      COPY A:\ROB_DES\*.* C:

2) Add this directory to the MATLAB search path by creating or editing the
   MATLAB STARTUP.M file:

      CD C:\MATLAB4
      EDIT STARTUP.M

   Include in this file the following line:

      matlabpath([matlabpath ';C:\MATLAB4\TOOLBOX\ROB_DES']);

3) First start windows then start MATLAB and test the installation by
   displaying a list of available ROB_DES functions and executing an
   example. From MATLAB prompt:

      HELP ROB_DES
      RD_EXAM
